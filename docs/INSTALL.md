if you did everything correctly, you can proceed with the web installation

open page for installation http://merchant.com/install where merchant.com you domain

![install](./assets/images/install_1.png)

the composer install button will install all the necessary dependencies for the backend application

after installing the dependencies you should redirect to the page http://merchant.com/setup

![install](./assets/images/install_2.png)

on this page you enter all your data from the database
redis and specify the processing url

at this stage, all access to the .env file will be established, as well as migrations to the database will be completed and your merchant will be registered in processing

if everything went well you should be redirected to the last page

![install](./assets/images/install_3.png)

On this page you need to enter your details from the merchantâ€™s personal account

At this step, a user with all privileges will be registered and the frontend part of the application will be assembled

after successful installation you can start using the merchant
